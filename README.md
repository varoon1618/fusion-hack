Welcome to CATLAB- 

This is a simple puzzle game I developed to introduce basic programming principles to someone with no coding experience 

WHAT IS THE GOAL OF THE GAME ? - 

In this game you play as a cat and the final goal is to navigate to the flower block without straying away from the stone path.

HOW DO I PLAY ? -

You can control the cat using by dragging and dropping the codeblocks at the bottom of the screen into the code panel on the right side

CONTROLS -

NOTE - these controls are NOT executed as soon as you drop it into the code panel.

In order to move the cat you need to click on run code after dragging and dropping into the code panel.

If the code panel is empty and you click run code, nothing will happen.

Move Forward - moves the cat forward by one block 

Turn right - turns the cat right (if the cat is currently facing north , it will face east after one turn right)

Turn left - turns the cat left (if the cat is currently facing north, the cat will now face west after a turn left)

Start Loop and End loop - Think of these blocks as repeaters. Anything between the startloop and endloop blocks will be repeated 3 times.

Once you are happy and think you have added all the code blocks to navigate to the flower click on run code to see if you were right. 

After executing all your commands, if the cat is on the flower you progress to the next level otherwise you can always retry.

ADDITIONAL BUTTONS -

Click on the clear all button (in the bottom right corner) to remove all the code from the codepanel.

Click on the show solution button (bottom right) if you are finding a level to be hard and want to see the solution.

NOTE - you have to click run code after clicking on show solution to view the movement of the cat.

Still Confused ? Dont worry there are some examples below to make things clearer

This is the first level :

I have dragged and dropped a single moveforward block into the code panel :

This is the result after clicking on run code :

As you can see the cat has moved one block forward. But it isnt on the flower your job is to move the cat to the flower.

Now lets look at a different snippet of code :

I have added move forward , turn right and move forward into the code panel by individually dragging and dropping them.

<img width="864" alt="image" src="https://github.com/varoon1618/fusion-hack/assets/114831390/ac4d182a-38be-4c42-bc4f-0ec8682d3ca9">

This is the result after clicking run code: 

<img width="868" alt="image" src="https://github.com/varoon1618/fusion-hack/assets/114831390/beded34d-0765-4371-a38e-9f7449863d82">

Now the cat is facing south and on the second block. How did this happen ?

The cat initially is facing east and when it moves forward once it is now on the second block. After a turn right it is now facing south. Now a move forward here 
is not possible as you always have to stay on the stone path.

Hopefully this made it slightly clearer but dont worry if it didnt once you start playing you will get the hang of it.
Happy coding :)
